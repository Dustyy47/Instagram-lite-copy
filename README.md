**About Project**: </br>
Hello world! It\`s my first MERN project. The main task was to create a simple copy of famous social network - Instagram. To be honest I am an absolutely zero in AI (my bad), so  you won\`t see anything about "heavy alghoritms" in this repo. But if you\`re a beginner in webdev, I\`m sure, this will be useful for you!
  >A few words about contributor - [Alexander](https://github.com/energy-spectrum) his opportunity is to improove the server with using Go and PostgreSQL.
